- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Implement a video player that can stream videos from S3.
- <strong>Controls</strong>: Basic video controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen).

##### YOUTUBE API

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Publish uploaded videos to YouTube.
- <strong>Integration</strong>: Use the YouTube API to enable video publishing directly from the platform.
- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Allow users to select a video from the list and publish it to their connected YouTube account.

### Phase 2: Version 1

#### Objective

Enhance the POC with advanced features including a refined UI design, authentication system, role-based access control, team collaboration features, video version control, and social account integration.

#### Requirements

##### UI Design

- <strong>Design Principles</strong>: Ensure the UI is intuitive, responsive, and accessible.

##### AUTH

- <strong>Feature</strong>Feature: Add authentication with signup/login functionality.
- <strong>Methods</strong>Methods: Support email/password and social logins (Google, Facebook).

##### ROLE

- <strong>Feature</strong>Feature: Define roles (editor, manager, admin, guest) with specific permissions.
- <strong>Access Control</strong>: Restrict or grant access to functionalities based on the user's role.

##### TEAM

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Enable team creation and management.
- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Users can create teams, invite members via email, and assign roles within the team.

##### VIDEO ACCESS

- <strong>Feature</strong>Feature: Control access to videos at an individual or team level.
- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Video uploaders can specify who can view or edit videos.

##### Version Control for Video Projects

- <strong>Feature</strong>Feature: Implement version control for edited videos.
- <strong>Versioning</strong>: Automatically assign version numbers (v1, v2, etc.) to edited videos.

##### SOCIAL ACCOUNTS

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Allow users to connect multiple social media accounts.
- <strong>Supported Platforms</strong>: YouTube, Twitch, and others as feasible.
- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Enable video publishing to connected accounts.

#### Phase 3: Version 2

#### Objective

Incorporate AI-driven tools for video optimization, and provide analytics for video performance across platforms.

#### Requirements

##### AI

- <strong>Feature</strong>: AI tools to generate video metadata.
- <strong>Functionality</strong>: Auto-generate titles, descriptions, captions, subtitles, timestamps, keynotes, and tags.

##### STATS

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Analytics dashboard showing video performance stats.
- <strong>Metrics</strong>: Views, likes, comments, engagements, watch time, subscriber growth across platforms.

### Phase 4: Version 3

#### Objective

Focus on platform scalability, enhance the UI and backend systems for better performance, and introduce a billing system for premium features.

#### Requirements

##### Feedback on Edited Videos

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Tools for annotating and commenting on specific parts of videos.
- <strong>Collaboration</strong>: Enhance team collaboration with timestamp-specific feedback.

##### Platform Scalability

- <strong>Feature</strong>: Enhance infrastructure to support a growing user base.
- <strong>Technologies</strong>: Consider cloud scalability options, CDN for media delivery.

##### UI and System Monitoring Tools
